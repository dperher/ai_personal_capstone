# Why doing a project of this nature?

Foe 6 months, Deloitte's AI Academy has provided me basic knowledge regarding the fascinanting world of data analysis and artifical intelligence. From basic Python functions, through SQL queries and Pandas data manipulation, to advanced mathematical models that employ any kind of data (structured, unestructured) to classify or predict behaviours previously unknown to us and that now are essential at any workplace where decision-making takes place.

This is a summary and application of all these knowledge and techniques with a clear purpose: extract and analyze data, generate information from it and build up  machine learning-powered models that can give solution to personal or business needs, leaning towards scalable automation.
