# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

A capstone project by Daniel Pérez Hernández

# Why doing a project of this nature?

This project has its basis on all the core topics learnt throughout the AI Academy. From data extraction and data cleaning, to various machine learning models oriented towards sofisticated topics like Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks or Pipeline creation. This is a summary and application of all knowledge and techniques of the data science world: analyze data to generate information and build up a machine learning-powered model.
